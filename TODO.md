# Pending Tasks for Luma Diagnostics

## Package Metadata Update (Priority)
- [ ] Run full test suite to verify everything works
- [ ] Merge `feature/case-management` branch into `main`
- [ ] Tag new version (v0.1.1)
- [ ] Build and publish updated package to PyPI with corrected metadata
      - Updated author information
      - Clarified unofficial status
      - Fixed repository links

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md to clarify community project status
- [ ] Update GitHub repository description to include "unofficial"
- [ ] Consider adding a community guidelines section
- [ ] Review and update issue templates if needed

## Development

## Notes
- Current PyPI version (0.1.0) is functional but has incorrect metadata
- Changes to clarify unofficial status are committed to `feature/case-management` branch
- No immediate action needed - handle when time permits
